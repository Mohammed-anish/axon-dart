// We need to import the class we are attaching to, but since Root is in bin/,
// we can't easily import it here without a circular dependency or bad practice.
// 
// BETTER PATTERN: The Validator should target the Route's Type manually, OR
// usually Routes are also in lib/. 
// 
// For now, I will use a string-based approach or just rely on the fact that 
// I can attach to "Root" if I import it? No, I can't import bin/ from lib/.
//
// SOLUTION: Move Root route to lib/routes/root.dart as well.

// Let's first try to keep Root in bin/main.dart and see if we can attach to it.
// Actually, we can't refer to 'Root' class here if it is in bin/main.dart.
// So 'Root' class ALSO needs to be moved to lib/.

// 1. Move Root class to lib/routes/root_route.dart
// 2. Move RootValidator to lib/validators/root_validator.dart
// 3. Import both in main.dart
